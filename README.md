Labs do not assume familiarity with Julia.  While it can be useful to "read" selected portions of the code, the lab tutorials aim to emphasize understanding how algorithms work, while minimizing need to pay attention to a language's syntax.

## Running Labs
Instructions will be provided for students to run labs on AWS severs during the summer school.  Below are instruction for running them outside of the summer school.

TODO: Add instructions for Pluto or Jupyter, depending on lab format
